## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://kube.acho.io/service/general-ledger
```

## Authentication

<Info>
  All API requests require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.
</Info>

```bash
curl -X GET https://kube.acho.io/service/general-ledger/accounts \
  -H "Authorization: jwt YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Request Format

### Headers

| Header | Value | Required |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `Authorization` | `jwt YOUR_TOKEN` | Yes |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Yes (for POST/PUT) |
| `X-Idempotency-Key` | Unique identifier | Recommended for mutations |

### Idempotency

For critical operations like approvals and payments, include an idempotency key to prevent duplicate processing:

```bash
curl -X POST https://kube.acho.io/service/general-ledger/bills/{bill_id}/approve \
  -H "Authorization: jwt YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Idempotency-Key: unique-request-id-123"
```

## Response Format

### Success Response

```json
{
  "account_id": "1000",
  "account_name": "Cash",
  "account_type": "Asset",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Account ID already exists",
    "details": {
      "field": "account_id",
      "value": "1000"
    }
  }
}
```

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `limit` | Number of results per page | 20 |
| `offset` | Number of results to skip | 0 |

```bash
GET /service/general-ledger/accounts?limit=50&offset=100
```

## Date Formats

All dates use ISO 8601 format:

- **Date only**: `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2024-01-15`)
- **Date and time**: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` (e.g., `2024-01-15T10:30:00Z`)

## Multi-Currency Support

Aden supports multi-currency operations:

- Amounts are represented as numbers with up to 2 decimal places
- Currency codes follow ISO 4217 (e.g., `USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`)
- Exchange rates are stored with up to 6 decimal places
- Multi-entity consolidation handles currency conversion automatically

## Multi-Entity Support

Aden's API supports multi-entity operations for organizations with multiple legal entities:

- Each API call operates within the context of a specific entity
- Consolidated reporting aggregates data across entities
- Inter-company transactions are tracked automatically

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **Standard limit**: 1000 requests per minute
- **Burst limit**: 100 requests per second

When rate limited, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid input |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing token |
| `403` | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist |
| `409` | Conflict - Resource already exists or state conflict |
| `422` | Unprocessable Entity - Business rule violation |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal Server Error |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Idempotency Keys">
    Always include idempotency keys for POST requests that modify data, especially for approvals and payments. This prevents duplicate transactions if a request is retried.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle Pagination">
    When fetching lists, always implement pagination handling. Don't assume all results fit in one response.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validate Before Submit">
    Use the `/applicable` endpoint to check which approval rules will apply before submitting documents for approval.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check Document Status">
    Before performing workflow actions, always check the document's current status to ensure the action is valid.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Proper Error Handling">
    Implement robust error handling for all API calls. Check for specific error codes to provide appropriate user feedback.
  </Accordion>
