## What is the Aden MCP Server?

The Aden MCP Server exposes Aden's General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, and financial reporting APIs to AI agents like Claude through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

This enables AI assistants to:
- Create and manage journal entries
- Process bills and invoices
- Generate financial reports
- Execute approval workflows
- Manage chart of accounts and accounting periods
