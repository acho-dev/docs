## Common Issues

### Authentication Issues

#### Cannot Find Developer Token

**Problem:** You don't know where to find your API key/developer token.

**Solution:** Generate a developer token from your Aden dashboard:

1. Log in to your [Aden Dashboard](https://app.adenhq.com)
2. Go to **Settings** > **API Keys**
3. Click on **Generate New Key**
4. Copy the key immediately and store it securely

For detailed instructions, see [Generate Developer Token](/getting-started/create-account#generate-developer-token).

<Tip>
Store your API key in an environment variable:
```bash
export ADEN_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```
</Tip>

### SSL Certificate Issues

#### SSL Certificate Verification Error (macOS)

**Problem:** When connecting to `kube.acho.io` or other HTTPS endpoints, you encounter an SSL certificate verification error similar to:

```
ssl.SSLCertVerificationError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate
```

This occurs because Python on macOS doesn't use the system certificate store by default and cannot verify the server's SSL certificate.

**Solution (macOS):** Run the Install Certificates command that comes with Python:

```bash
/Applications/Python\ 3.x/Install\ Certificates.command
```

Replace `3.x` with your Python version (e.g., `3.11`, `3.12`).

**What this does:** This command installs the necessary root certificates from the `certifi` package that Python uses for SSL verification.

**Alternative Solution:** If the command doesn't work or you installed Python via Homebrew/pyenv, you can install certificates manually:

```bash
pip install --upgrade certifi
```

<Warning>
Never disable SSL verification in production code (e.g., `verify=False`). Always fix the certificate issue properly.
</Warning>

### Installation Issues

#### Package Not Found

**Problem:** `pip install aden-py` fails or package is not found.

**Solution:**

1. Ensure you're using Python 3.8 or higher:
```bash
python --version
```

2. Upgrade pip:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

3. Try installing again:
```bash
pip install aden-py
```

#### Dependency Conflicts

**Problem:** Installing `aden-py` causes conflicts with other packages.

**Solution:** Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install aden-py
```

#### pip vs pip3 / python vs python3 (macOS)

**Problem:** The documentation uses `pip` and `python`, but you have `pip3` and `python3` installed on your Mac. Commands like `pip install aden-py` fail with "command not found".

**Why this happens:** macOS comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed (older versions), and when you install Python 3, it's often available as `python3` and `pip3` to avoid conflicts. The system `python` command may point to Python 2.7.

**Solution:** Use `pip3` and `python3` instead of `pip` and `python`:

```bash
# Instead of: pip install aden-py
pip3 install aden-py

# Instead of: python --version
python3 --version

# Instead of: python your_script.py
python3 your_script.py
```

**Better Solution - Create Aliases:** Add these to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
alias python=python3
alias pip=pip3
```

Then reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bash_profile
```

**Best Solution - Use Virtual Environments:** This automatically uses the correct Python version:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# Now 'python' and 'pip' automatically point to Python 3
pip install aden-py
python your_script.py
```

<Tip>
Check which Python version you're using:
```bash
python --version  # or python3 --version
which python      # or which python3
```
</Tip>

### Instrumentation Issues

#### No Metrics Being Captured

**Problem:** After calling `instrument()`, no metrics are being emitted.

**Solution:**

1. Verify you're calling `instrument()` before importing LLM provider SDKs:

```python
# ✅ Correct order
from aden import instrument, MeterOptions, create_console_emitter

instrument(MeterOptions(
    emit_metric=create_console_emitter(pretty=True),
))

from openai import OpenAI  # Import AFTER instrumentation

# ❌ Incorrect order
from openai import OpenAI  # Too early!
from aden import instrument
instrument(...)
```

2. Check that you're using a supported provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini).

3. Verify your emitter is configured correctly. Try using `create_console_emitter()` for debugging.

#### Async/Await Errors

**Problem:** Getting errors like `RuntimeError: This event loop is already running` or instrumentation not working in async contexts.

**Solution:** Use `instrument_async()` instead of `instrument()` when working in async contexts:

```python
# For async applications
from aden import instrument_async, MeterOptions

await instrument_async(MeterOptions(
    api_key=os.environ["ADEN_API_KEY"],
))
```

### Connection Issues

#### Cannot Connect to Control Server

**Problem:** SDK cannot connect to the Aden control server at `kube.acho.io`.

**Checklist:**

1. **Verify API Key:** Ensure your `ADEN_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly
2. **Check Network:** Verify you can reach the server:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://kube.acho.io
   ```
3. **SSL Certificates:** See [SSL Certificate Verification Error](#ssl-certificate-verification-error-macos) above
4. **Firewall:** Check if your firewall or corporate proxy is blocking the connection

#### Timeout Errors

**Problem:** Requests to the control server are timing out.

**Solution:**

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the control server status
3. If behind a proxy, configure proxy settings:

```python
import os
os.environ['HTTPS_PROXY'] = 'http://proxy.example.com:8080'
```
