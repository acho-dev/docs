## Shared Intelligence for AI Agents

Aden is the orchestration layer that connects your AI agents to a shared memory. Every agent learns from every interaction. Every department's knowledge flows to every other. The more agents you deploy, the smarter they all become.

## The Flywheel Effect

When your Legal team updates a compliance policy, your Sales agent knows instantly. When Support discovers a new edge case, every agent learns from it. Aden creates a network effect inside your organization - each new agent makes all existing agents smarter.

      emitMetric: createConsoleEmitter({ pretty: true }),
      sdks: { OpenAI },
    });

    // Use your SDK normally - metrics captured automatically
    const openai = new OpenAI();
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4o",
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
    });
